# Project title
  Student-habits-performance analysis

## 📌 Project Summary
    This project investigates how various student lifestyle habits—such as study time, sleep patterns and internet usage affect academic performance. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes responses from 300+ students across       
    multiple behavioral and academic indicators. Key variables include daily study hours, sleep duration, internet use frequency, and final exam scores. Using Python and Google Colab, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaned      and visualized the dataset, and identified correlations between lifestyle factors and student performance.

    Key findings showed that study-hours are the strongest predictor of exam performance followed by mental health-rating. Time spent on social media and Sleeping had a medium impact on students’ 
    performance and surprisingly, Parental education level had a mild impact, suggesting some background influence, though not as strong as daily habits. 

    This analysis helps educators and students better understand which habits contribute most to academic success.

## 🎯 Objectives
    - Explore and understand the impact of student habits (e.g., study hours, social media usage) on exam performance. 
    - Build predictive models to estimate exam scores based on these habits. 
    - Compare model performance and derive actionable insights.
